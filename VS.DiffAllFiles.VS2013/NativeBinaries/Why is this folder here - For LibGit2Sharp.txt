LibGit2Sharp.dll expects to find a NativeBinaries/[amd64|x86]/git2.dll assembly. This assembly is copied to the bin\[Debug|Release] directory, but not included in the VSIX.
In order to get this git2.dll assembly copied into the VSIX, we have to reference the git2.dll assemblies as a shortcut, and in the shortcut properties set Include In VSIX to True.
So these shortcut paths will need to be updated whenever a new version of the LibGit2Sharp NuGet package is installed.

Also, because we need to strongly name LibGit2Sharp, the strong name (i.e. PublicKeyToken) seems to change between Debug and Release mode, resulting in the assembly not being found when switching
between the two. The work around I've found is to remove the strong name from the assembly reference in the .csproj file.

e.g. In VS.DiffAllFiles.csproj change:
	<Reference Include="LibGit2Sharp, Version=0.22.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cbde695407f0333, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
to:
	<Reference Include="LibGit2Sharp">

This will likely need to be done whenever a new version of LibGit2Sharp is installed.
